# AI-Test_RAG

Follow the Given steps

1. Install the requirements.txt file.
2. Make the embedding for the given document. (I use in Text Loader)
3. Run the Embeddings_Pinecone.py to store the embeddings in Pinecone Vector Database.
4. Run AI-Test Solution 1.py to Execute Solution 1 which is pure RAG based approach.
5. Run AI-Test Solution 2.py to Execute Solution 2 without Vector Database. Becuase the Document is having approximately 100 to 200 words. So these words can be fit in PROMPT.
